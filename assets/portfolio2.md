    excerpt: "The internal problem to overcome is that there was no company documented knowledge of what and how to build. I implemented small building cells (of 3 people) between product, design, and development along with Product Requirement Documents (PRDs) to build understanding, agreement, ownership, and proper communication with stakeholders internally to the company and externally."
