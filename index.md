‚ò∫Ô∏è  Hey there! I‚Äôm Benji, a Product Manager aiming to build tech products with real impact. My portfolio shows how I‚Äôve delivered results with strategy and collaboration.

üëæ Fun fact: I've researched urban art, and like to learn of User Experience [UX].

{% include gallery caption="This is a sample gallery to go along with this case study." %}

Here are some of my works, in the spirit of [OnePage/OneHour](https://www.onepageonehour.com/about). Most things here belong to collective efforts. I share results, my thinking process and projects.
