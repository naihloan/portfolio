    excerpt: "The internal problem to overcome is that there was no company documented knowledge of what and how to build. I implemented small building cells (of 3 people) between product, design, and development along with Product Requirement Documents (PRDs) to build understanding, agreement, ownership, and proper communication with stakeholders internally to the company and externally."

‚ò∫Ô∏è  Hey there! I‚Äôm Benji, a Product Manager aiming to build tech products with real impact. My portfolio shows how I‚Äôve delivered results with strategy and collaboration.

üëæ Fun fact: I've researched urban art, and like to learn of User Experience [UX].

üõ†Ô∏è Here are some of my works, in the spirit of [OnePage/OneHour](https://www.onepageonehour.com/about). Most things here belong to collective efforts. I share results, my thinking process and projects.
